    <h1>My solution to "Android Doomsday"</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>So, I own a Pixel 7. Bought it in 2023 (maybe 2024?), loved it ever since. Now, here's the issue. My phone's official operating system updates are being cut off in 2026, with Android 17.</p>
    <p>This issue will leave me dead in the dust with none of the cool new Google features they add. This is what I call "Android Doomsday". Happens to every device, but it still sucks.</p>
    <p>My solution to this: Get a new Android ROM.</p>
    <p>When that day comes, I'll consider my options and if everything seems right, I'll switch to an Android OS like <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> or <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>.</p>
    <p>Now, this is a big step. So, maybe I'll stick with normal Android. Until that day comes, I have no clue what I'll do.</p>
    <p>When my phone's security updates end, is when I'll be buying a new Android or switching. When that day comes, there will be no "no". Security is the most important thing to me in a phone, and if updates like those end, that's no bueno.</p>
    <p>But then again, that's just my thoughts.</p>
    <p>(on an unrelated note, this blog might be moved to leaflet! ill consider it then maybe make the switch)</p>
